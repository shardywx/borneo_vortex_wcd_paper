# Borneo Vortex three-dimensional structure
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that allow the user to reproduce some of the figures from the [paper](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1312-EC1) currently going through peer-review in Weather and Climate Dynamics. 

The study uses Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) data and a balance approximation tool, which partitions the flow into components forced by diabatic heating and large-scale forcing, to calculate diagnostics relevant to the Borneo vortex, a synoptic-scale cyclone that frequently produces extreme rainfall over the Maritime Continent. More details on the balance approximation tool can be found in this [2018 paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5521/3/4/72). 

Users will still need to download the relevant observational and model datasets to be able to successfully reproduce the graphics in the paper, but these notebooks provide some guidance and insight into how we put our analysis together. Details of how to access and download these datasets are found in the `Code and data availability` statement in the [paper](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1312-EC1). The eventual aim of this repository is to put together a set of refactored notebooks that covers all the figures included in the paper. This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.
